# @dpritchett's Jokes

Convenient personal shell scripts written in Joker.

__What's Joker and why are you using it for convenience scripts?__

- Joker is a minimal Clojure interpreter build in Go
- Which means it starts up super fast
- And that it enables lispy DSLs-
- which can evolve with very little effort to keep pace with my current mental model of my problem spaces
